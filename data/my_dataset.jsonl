{"prompt": "What is a module in Python?", "response": "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements intended for use in other Python programs."}
{"prompt": "What is a package in Python?", "response": "A package is a namespace that organizes a set of related modules and provides a way of structuring Python’s module namespace by using 'dotted module names'."}

{"prompt": "What is a virtual environment in Python?", "response": "A virtual environment is a tool to keep dependencies required by different projects in separate places, by creating isolated Python environments for them."}
{"prompt": "What is a decorator in Python?", "response": "A decorator is a function that takes another function and extends its behavior without explicitly modifying it."}
{"prompt": "What is a generator in Python?", "response": "A generator is a function that returns iterator that produces a sequence of values when iterated over."}

{"prompt": "What is an instance in Python?", "response": "An instance is an individual object of a certain class in Python."}
{"prompt": "What is inheritance in Python?", "response": "Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class."}
{"prompt": "What is polymorphism in Python?", "response": "Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface."}
{"prompt": "What is encapsulation in Python?", "response": "Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components."}
{"prompt": "What is abstraction in Python?", "response": "Abstraction is a feature of object-oriented programming that hides the implementation details and shows only the functionality to the user."}
{"prompt": "What is a method in Python?", "response": "A method is a function that is associated with an object in Python."}
{"prompt": "What is a constructor in Python?", "response": "A constructor is a special method that is called when an object is instantiated in Python."}
