{"prompt": "What is inheritance in Python?", "response": "Inheritance is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class."}
{"prompt": "What is polymorphism in Python?", "response": "Polymorphism is a feature of object-oriented programming that allows different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface."}
{"prompt": "What is encapsulation in Python?", "response": "Encapsulation is the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components."}
{"prompt": "What is abstraction in Python?", "response": "Abstraction is a feature of object-oriented programming that hides the implementation details and shows only the functionality to the user."}
